					suppoyo. is a contract creator that allows two people to invest a percentage of their incomes in one another for mutual benefit. Each person will also invest support (networking, referrals, project help, etc.) in the other person in order to help one another. We are currently in the testing phase and are looking for participants who share our vision.

				<div class="question">
					<h4>What is the idea behind this?</h4>
					<p>
						At amatus. we dream of a world in which collaboration is more common than competition, in which the success of our peers does not come at the expense of our own. We are passionate about designing systems that incentivize benevolent behavior, while creating benefits for everyone involved.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="question">
					<h4>What other use cases are there?</h4>
					<p>
						The possibilities are endless! You can decide for yourself how the collaboration will look like. Here are two more examples:<br><br>
1. UX designer partners with business consultant:  the UX designer offers design lessons, networking and referrals support in return for Business strategy, sales pitch and networking from the business consultants, this is supported by agreeing to share 1% of their net monthly incomes with each other for the duration of six months.<br><br>
2. Fashion artist partners with Event manager:  the fashion artist offers networking, contract referrals and space design  support in return for introduction to event spaces, showcasing projects and networking from the event manager, this is supported by agreeing to share 2% of their net monthly incomes with each other for the duration of four months.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="question">
					<h4>How will the contract negotiation work?</h4>
					<p>
						After you have each submitted your income statements and your desired support exchange, you can sign the contracts and send upload them to the suppoyo platform.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="question" id="what-happens">
					<h4>What does the contract look like?</h4>
					<p>
						As suppoyo stands for transparency and trust we will simplify the contract structure and highlight the parts where you should pay attention. Once you send us your checklist from your first meeting, we will draft the contracts on your behalf. This way you can focus on your success and support of your partner.

						There are two contracts.  <br><br>1. Support agreement: This contract is signed between you and your partner agreeing on the support areas and the percentage of income exchanged.  <br><br>2. Terms and Conditions: This contract is signed between you, your partner and Amatus. The contract explains the terms and conditions and also serves as evidence, to further support the support agreement.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="question">
					<h4>What happens once I sign the contract?</h4>
					<p>
						We expect that with the help, support and skill sharing you’ll be exchanging, both of you will grow and progress in your careers. We expect you to meet at least once monthly to collaborate and share feedback. We are happy to help schedule and structure this meeting for you. Each month, you will each place the percentage of your incomes that you agreed upon in a savings or separate bank account.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="question">
					<h4>How much of my income do I have to invest?</h4>
					<p>
						Of course, you are totally free in choosing how much of your income you want to invest.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="question">
					<h4>When are the shares paid out?</h4>
					<p>
						Shares are paid out at the end of the six months, or at the end of the contract if it’s canceled by either party beforehand.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="question">
					<h4>What are the risks?</h4>
					<p>
						None, really.
You can decide to cancel the contract at any time, with a two week notice period.
</p>
				</div>
				<div class="question">
					<h4>How long does the study run for?</h4>
					<p>
						Six months.<br><br>
We will gather your feedback at the end of each month. You can cancel the contract at any point. We just ask that you give us and your partner a two week notice.
